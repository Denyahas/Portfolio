      <div id="tribute-info">
        <p>
          Sergio is highly intelligent and meticulous. He appears to be very
          determined to pull off the greatest money heists in history, after
          planning for it for several years. Once he recruits his dream team, he
          makes everyone religiously follow a strict schedule, complete with
          fundamental rules to prepare for and execute the heist. His
          perfectionist attitude is apparent through his careful consideration
          and planning for all possible scenarios that could arise during the
          heist. This forward-thinking approach helps him in his strive for
          perfection, where he urges the team to 'stick to the plan' in every
          situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Professor appears to have exceptional knowledge in negotiation
          tactics, police strategy, weaponry, law enforcement, hostage crises
          aversion, forgery, theft and bank robberies. He was able to control
          the entirety of the heist from behind the scenes, playing with the
          police and constantly tricking them into doing exactly what he wanted
          them to do. He also demonstrates a deep understanding of human
          psychology. A majority of his plans gravely depend upon the reactions
          he predicts from the police, the government, and the public. This
          allows him to play a tense game of one-upmanship with Inspector Raquel
          Murillo, where he repeatedly manages to shift the status quo in favor
          of his team during the heist, despite overwhelming odds.
        </p>
        <p>
          His calm demeanor complements his innate leadership traits, which
          allows him to resolve team conflicts without a fuss. Moreover, team
          members have great trust in his plans and decision-making ability.
          This is apparent when the team chooses to respect the protocol of
          waiting for 24 hours for his phone telephone call before activating
          'Plan Chernobyl', despite clear evidence on the television of his
          impending imprisonment a few hours before the deadline. They do this
          as they have immense respect for his intellect and believe he will do
          everything in his power to save the team from any crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sergio also thinks of himself as a strategist similar to a
          chess-player, who needs to carefully calculate every move before
          arriving at a conclusion. This allows him to make crucial decisions in
          very short periods of time when situations go awry. He may possibly be
          an expert martial artist, as he easily subdues Alberto and Raquel on
          separate occasions. He is shown practicing boxing and undergoing
          intense physical training in his hideout.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite planning the biggest heist in human history, the Professor
          maintains stringent moral principles. He refrains from killing
          Raquel's mother even when it appears to be the only possibility of
          survival for the heist. He maintains that not spilling blood is the
          most important rule of the heist. However, it is unclear if this is
          only due to consideration of public opinion, or if it arises from a
          moral standpoint. He also shows great compassion and love for his team
          members, despite beginning his heist classes with the 'No Personal
          Relationships' rule.
